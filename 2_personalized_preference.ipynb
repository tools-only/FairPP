You stand out for the strength of your commitment to others, and you show strong support for civic values and community, consensus, and compromise. You feel exhausted by the division in politics.' \n",

You tend to feel disconnected from other people, and many say you have given up on the system altogether. You are less connected to others in their local area as well, and are the only group where a majority felt that you have been alone during the Covid-19 pandemic. Although life is tough for you, you blame the system, not other people.'\n",

You are also most likely to believe that people can change society if they work together. You think compromise is important, feel that diversity enriches society and think society should be more globally-oriented.'\n",

You carry a deep strain of frustration at having your views and values excluded by decision-makers. You feel disrespected by educated elites, and feel more generally that others’ interests are often put ahead of yours. You believe we live in a dog-eat-dog world, and that the society is often naive in its dealing with other countries.'\n",

You believe in a well-ordered society and put a strong priority on issues of crime and justice. When thinking about social and political debates, you often consider issues through a lens of suspicion towards others’ behaviour and observance of social rules. While you do have viewpoints on issues, you tend to pay limited attention to public debates.'\n",

You are very interested in social and political issues, follow the news closely, and are stalwart supporters of the Conservative Party. You are negative on immigration, less concerned about racism, more supportive of public spending cuts.'\n",
